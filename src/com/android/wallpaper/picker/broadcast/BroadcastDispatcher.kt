/**
 * WallpaperPicker master Broadcast Dispatcher.
 *
 * This class allows [BroadcastReceiver] to register and centralizes registrations to [Context] from
 * WallpaperPicker. That way the number of calls to [BroadcastReceiver.onReceive] can be reduced for
 * a given broadcast.
 *
 * Use only for IntentFilters with actions and optionally categories. It does not support schemes,
 * data types, data authorities or priority different than 0.
 *
 * Cannot be used for getting sticky broadcasts (either as return of registering or as re-delivery).
